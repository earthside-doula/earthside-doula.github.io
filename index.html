							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/test-2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								I’m Nichole, a Certified Labor Doula. It’s lovely to meet you! I have lived in the Pacific Northwest 
								all of my life and truly love this area of the world. I have a background in Cultural and Biological Anthropology
								 which gives me a deeper meaning of humanity in the context of the complex cultural and interpersonal 
								 influences that we all experience. This knowledge allows me to truly meet people where they are and appreciate 
								 how individuals bring variety to the community. Beyond this, living in the Pacific Northwest surrounded by 
								 nature my entire life has led me to have a deep love of the beautiful environment that surrounds us. Nature 
								 is immensely grounding in my life and I do everything in my power to preserve and respect our environment. 
								 I also have a great love for cooking and acquiring local ingredients. Going to the Farmers Market, supporting 
								 local vendors, and then cooking a beautiful meal for the people I care about feeds my soul.  Additionally, 
								 I have a deep love for traveling and exploring new countries by immersing myself within local cultures has 
								 opened up my world view in profound ways. <br>
								 Thank you for allowing me to share part of my story!
							</p>
							<h2>What is a Labor Doula?</h2>
							<p>
								A Labor Doula is someone you add to your care team to provide support to the birthing family before and during labor. 
								Most of the time this includes physical and emotional support throughout the entire process. Hiring a Labor Doula has been 
								statistically proven to lead to better birth outcomes.
							</p>
							<h2>How I Doula</h2>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/prodoula-certified-labor-badge.png" alt="" /></span>
								I am a Certified Labor Doula through Prodoula. I approach support in a compassionate, non-judgmental,  and evidence 
								based manor. As your Doula I encourage self advocacy and most of all listen to the needs of my clients. My support 
								covers emotional and physical needs of the parents under my care. My care tactics are backed by evidence and experience 
								to provide meaningful support for the birthing family. Birth is about community with the birthing person at the center 
								of all connections. That community could be made of many different combinations of a support team including medical 
								staff, midwives, doulas, and family members. As your Doula, part of my role is to continually surround the birthing 
								person with support from the community around them. When I am your Doula you are always the center of your birthing 
								experience and the power is always in your hands. My goal is always to create joy and encouragement in the birth space 
								and compassionately help families bring their babies <strong>Earthside</strong>.
